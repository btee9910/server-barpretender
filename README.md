Project on live [coming soon]
## MOTIVATION
BarPretender is a cocktail recipe app. It has two features. The one feature is that an user can  choose a cocktail from a list to access a recipe. Another feature enables users to select some ingredients they have at hand and list out what cocktails can be made with selected ingredients.
## ABOUT

## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
- Currently only the admin can make contributions to the app through create/edit/delete functions. In the futre this feature can be extended to the users by associating users to cocktails.
- Adding 'forget username, password' feature.
- Further interactions with the user can be implemented. For example user can like/dilike cocktails or can add comments to be more interactive.
## LESSONS LEARNT
